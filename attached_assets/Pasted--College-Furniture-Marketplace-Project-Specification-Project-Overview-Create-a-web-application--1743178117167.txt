# College Furniture Marketplace Project Specification

## Project Overview
Create a web application that enables college students to buy and sell used furniture within their university community, focusing on ease of use, security, and a streamlined user experience.

## Technical Architecture
### Frontend
- Framework: Next.js (React)
- State Management: React Context
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Vercel

### Backend
- Framework: FastAPI (Python)
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Custom JWT with university email verification
- Deployment: Railway

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication
- University email domain verification
- Secure registration process
- JWT-based authentication
- Profile creation with university validation

### 2. Marketplace Functionality
#### Listing Creation
- Easy, step-by-step furniture listing process
- Multiple image upload (up to 5 images)
- Detailed product information fields:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Price
  - Condition (New, Like New, Good, Fair)
  - Category (Furniture type)
- Automatic pricing suggestions

#### Listing Discovery
- Advanced search functionality
- Filters:
  - Price range
  - Furniture type
  - Condition
  - University
- Grid and list view options
- Sorting capabilities (newest, lowest price, etc.)

### 3. User Interactions
- In-app messaging system
- User ratings and reviews
- Report listing functionality
- Favorite/save listings feature

## Design Requirements
### User Interface
- Minimalist and clean design
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Color Palette:
  - Primary: Soft blue (#3B82F6)
  - Secondary: Light gray (#F3F4F6)
  - Accent: Vibrant green (#10B981)
- Typography:
  - Primary font: Inter
  - Headings: Bold, 20-24px
  - Body text: Regular, 16px

### User Experience Principles
- Maximum 3 clicks to create a listing
- Intuitive navigation
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Instant form validation
- Quick loading times

## Security Considerations
- University email verification
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure file uploads
- HTTPS everywhere
- Input sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Performance Targets
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- Mobile performance score: > 90/100
- Server response time: < 200ms

## Monetization Strategy
- Free basic listings
- Optional featured listing upgrades
- Transaction fee on successful sales (10%)

## Technical Specifications
### Database Schema
```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True)
    email = Column(String, unique=True)
    university = Column(String)
    verified = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    listings = relationship("Listing", back_populates="user")

class Listing(Base):
    __tablename__ = "listings"
    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String)
    description = Column(Text)
    price = Column(Float)
    condition = Column(String)
    images = Column(ARRAY(String))
    user_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    status = Column(String, default="active")
```

## Development Milestones
1. Authentication system (2 weeks)
2. Basic marketplace functionality (3 weeks)
3. User interaction features (2 weeks)
4. Design refinement and testing (2 weeks)
5. Initial launch and beta testing (1 week)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Create detailed wireframes
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement authentication flow
4. Build core database models
5. Develop frontend components
6. Integrate frontend and backend
7. Implement testing
8. Deploy MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Future Enhancements
- Mobile app development
- Machine learning for pricing recommendations
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Social sharing features
- Expanded university network
